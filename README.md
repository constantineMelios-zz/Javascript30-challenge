# Javascript30-challenge

## My take on Wes Bos' famous 30 Days of JavaScript 
Grab the course at https://JavaScript30.com

### Day 1 🥁

Drum kit was tougher than it seemed! Good reminder of how to play sounds on page.

### Day 2

Clock was an interesting project. I even solved something by chance 😳
(Ok by mistake I used an experimental feature which translates an element around. I fix it using a left margin)
