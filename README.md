# Javascript30-challenge

## My take on Wes Bos' famous 30 Days of JavaScript 
Grab the course at https://JavaScript30.com

### Day 1 | Drum -Kit 🥁

Drum kit was tougher than it seemed! Good reminder of how to play sounds on page.

### Day 2 | Clock ⌚

Clock was an interesting project. I even solved something by chance 😳
(Ok by mistake I used an experimental feature which translates an element around. I fix it using a left margin)

### Day 3 | CSS Variables 🚀

Nice little project. Learned how to target root documentElement!

### Day 4 | Array Cardio 1 🏃

That was a wonderful practice for short() map() reduce() filter()

### Day 5 | Flex Panel Gallery 💪

We all need some flexing on our CSS from time to time

### Day 6 | Type ahead ⌨️

Regex() & replace() was fun to use

### Day 7 | Array Cardio 2 🏃

Easy day. Nice learning new methods.

### Day 8 | Fun with Canvas 🎨

I needed a reminder to Canvas API

### Day 9 | Dev Tools Domination 🖥️

Playing around with dev tools.

### Day 10 | Hold Shift and Check Checkboxes ⬆️

Click event shiftKey was a new for me. Glad I find it out!

### Day 11 | Custom Video Player ▶

First time I needed to see the video first. Note to self: study the video API

### Day 12 | Key Sequence Detection 🔑

Quirky little project. 

```javascript
setTimeout(illness,1728000)
```

### Day 13 | Slide on Scroll ⛐

Debounce is very useful knowledge

### Day 14 | Javascript References VS Copying

ES6 made thinks so much easier. Great course about the subject from Dan Abramov [Just Javascript](https://justjavascript.com/). I wish it reset soon.
