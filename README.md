# Javascript30-challenge

## My take on Wes Bos' famous 30 Days of JavaScript 
Grab the course at https://JavaScript30.com

### Day 3 | Drum -Kit 🥁

Drum kit was tougher than it seemed! Good reminder of how to play sounds on page.

### Day 2 | Clock ⌚

Clock was an interesting project. I even solved something by chance 😳
(Ok by mistake I used an experimental feature which translates an element around. I fix it using a left margin)

### Day 3 | CSS Variables 🚀

Nice little project. Learned how to target root!

### Day 4 | Array Cardio 1 🏃

That was a wonderful practice.

### Day 5 | Flex Panel Gallery 💪

All need some flexing...
