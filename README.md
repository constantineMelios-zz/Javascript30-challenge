# Javascript30-challenge

## My take on Wes Bos' famous 30 Days of JavaScript 
Grab the course at https://JavaScript30.com

### Day 1 | Drum -Kit 🥁

Drum kit was tougher than it seemed! Good reminder of how to play sounds on page.

### Day 2 | Clock ⌚

Clock was an interesting project. I even solved something by chance 😳
(Ok by mistake I used an experimental feature which translates an element around. I fix it using a left margin)

### Day 3 | CSS Variables 🚀

Nice little project. Learned how to target root documentElement!

### Day 4 | Array Cardio 1 🏃

That was a wonderful practice for short() map() reduce() filter()

### Day 5 | Flex Panel Gallery 💪

We all need some flexing on our CSS from time to time

### Day 6 | Type ahead ⌨️

Regex() & replace() was fun to use

### Day 7 | Array Cardio 2 🏃

Easy day. Nice learning new methods.

### Day 8 | Dev Tools Domination 🖥️

Playing around with dev tools.
