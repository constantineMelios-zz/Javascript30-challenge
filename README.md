# Javascript30-challenge

## My take on Wes Bos' famous 30 Days of JavaScript 
Grab the course at https://JavaScript30.com

### Drum -Kit | Day 1 🥁

Drum kit was tougher than it seemed! Good reminder of how to play sounds on page.

### Clock | Day 2 ⌚

Clock was an interesting project. I even solved something by chance 😳
(Ok by mistake I used an experimental feature which translates an element around. I fix it using a left margin)

### CSS Variables | Day 3 🚀

Nice little project. Learned how to target root!
